		Zoom school is what scientists call the Big Sad. I think it would be less depressing if I made more friends. It's probably easier to make friends with people with similar interests, so this webapp can help you find people with similar interests! Click on profiles on the right side and search with using the bar up top. You can search multiple tags by separating them with commas! Best of luck and stay safe! (TLDR: I'm too shy to ask people if they like anime, so I made a web app)

			I struggle with creative names. When I thought of the idea for this webapp, the name was "Friend Finder" for. Unfortunately, that name is not great. I couldn't really think of any cool names, so I decided to double down on the stupid, because at least it's funny that way. FFFF stands for "Friend Finder: Find Friends." My single remaining brain cell has definitely pulled through for me on this one.
